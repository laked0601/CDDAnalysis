# CDDAnalysis
A project that collects data from multiple sources on individuals and companies for customer due dilligence. Stores all data in seperate SQL tables and joins them together with views for consolidated queries.
<h2>üìå Description</h2>
<p>The Consolidated Sanctions List project downloads data from various sources such as the ICIJ website, the UK Sanctions List, and the Interpol Red Notices site for individuals and legal entities. The data is then stored in a series of SQLite tables and queried via views to get a consolidated list of individuals across all three sources. The application is accessed via a web interface on a Flask server that can be started by invoking the "start_flask_server.bat" script.</p>
<h2>‚öôÔ∏è How it Works</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The latest copy of the UK Individual Sanctions list is downloaded in XML from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list</a></li>
  <li>Queries are made to the backend API that holds the Interpol Red Notices data at <a href="https://ws-public.interpol.int/notices/v1/red">https://ws-public.interpol.int/notices/v1/red</a></li>
  <li>Finally, the offshore leaks database is collected from <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database">https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database</a></li>
  <li>All three sources are combined into seperate tables in an SQLLite database. A main view called "Individuals" consolidates all of these tables and formats with the following query:</li>

<ul><li>Once this is complete, the flask server can be started which includes a form and api for making queries to this table through a web interface.<br>Start "start_flask_server.bat" and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see for yourself.</li></ul>

<h2>üìÅ Installation</h2>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Install Python and add it to your system path<br><a href='https://www.python.org/downloads/'>https://www.python.org/downloads/</a></li>
  <li>Run 'setup.bat' or 'setup.sh'. This will create the required SQLite Database and populate the tables and views needed to store the data.</li>
  <li>*Optional* Install SQLite studio at <a href='https://sqlitestudio.pl/'>https://sqlitestudio.pl/</a>. This is a graphical interface for SQLite will make reading and understanding the data in the SQLite database much easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once complete, run 'main.py' to begin.</p>
